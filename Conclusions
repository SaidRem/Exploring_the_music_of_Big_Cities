music in two cities - Moscow and St. Petersburg - is listened to in different modes;

the lists of the ten most popular genres on Monday morning and Friday evening have characteristic differences;

the population of the two cities prefers different musical genres.

Overall results

Moscow and St. Petersburg agree in tastes: popular music prevails everywhere. At the same time, there is no dependence of preferences on the day of the week in each separate city - people constantly listen to what they the like. But there are differences between the cities in terms of days of the week: Moscow listens more on Monday and Friday, while St. Petersburg, on the contrary, listens more on Wednesday, but less on Monday and Friday.

As a result, indicate the first hypothesis is confirmed, the second hypothesis is not confirmed and the third is not confirmed.
